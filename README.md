### FAQ


#### Q: How can I launch the script at startup?

Just add a new entry to the startup applications, using the following as the "Command"-string;

`/<path>/<to>/spotify-notify/spotify-notify.py -s`

- Make sure that "spotify-notify.py" is executable
- Make note of the "-s" parameter at the end, as this makes sure that spotify-notify doesn't start Spotify, and that it doesn't quit when you quit Spotify.


#### Q: I want to use the script just for the media key support. How can I do this?

Launch with -n as parameter.


#### Q: Do I need Ubuntu to use this script? Will others distros work?

A: Other distros supporting the same messaging system might work, please report any success stories!


Spotify-notify is in no way affiliated with Spotify. Spotify is the registered trade mark of the Spotify Group.
